Problem 1
This folder contains a java file and pdf file. The java file contains the method that is used to sort the array as well as a main method that is used to run the sorting method. To run the program, the user should input the array elements within the main method where it says int[] a={...}. The user should also then input the number of array elements where it says arraySize=, and then run to get the sorted array result. The pdf file in this folder contains the run time analysis of the sort.

Problem 2
This folder also contains a java file and a pdf file. The java file contains the mergesort method along with a main method to run the code. To run the program, the user should follow the same steps as Problem 1, enter the array elements where it says int[] a={...} and they should also type in the size of the array for the variable arraySize. Running the program will output the sorted array. The pdf file contains the runt time analysis of the sort.

Problem 3
This folder contains the java file for this problem. Within the java file is the LinkedList contructor as well as several methods such as add to add onto the linked list and a printList method to output the linked list. An example of how the code should be tested is in the main method. Use add(x) where x is an integer to add onto the list and use printList() to output the linked list elements.
